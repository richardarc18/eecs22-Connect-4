I think I've hit most of the requirements of the assignment as close to their

The menu works fine and both versions (anvil and regular) are playing out as 
they should. 

Some of the things my program doesn't account for are
- Players attempting to put a piece on a full column
- Checking for when the board is full and declaring a tie (in anvil version)

Implementing working win conditions was one of the most difficult parts, as well as ensuring
that dropping the anvil works as specified.
